# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App, HTML and also a small Javascript challenge

**Thoughts:** The HTML part of the flask app went really well. I practiced using the Emmet abbreviations in VS Code, made everything super snappy.  The Javascript challenge was also fun.  I was able to see that it took me six lines of code to solve a simple challenge and the solution only needed one line of code plus a one line error built in.  Well at least I came up with a solution that worked. Student - 0 Instructor - 1  I realize I need to spend time understanding arrow functions in Javascript

### Day 0: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App with MongoDB, HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** It was super fun. Opening the python virtual environment, installing all the python modules, creating the Flask app with the routes for Mongo DB, which I just binge learned the week before (watching every video tutorial imaginable). Plus I spent 4 days pulling my hair out, and my computer literally threatened to report me, while trying to get MongoDB to actually run on the non-admin account on my computer.
