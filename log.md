# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Flask App with MongoDB, HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** It was super fun. Opening the python virtual environment, installing all the python modules, creating the Flask app with the routes for Mongo DB, which I just binge learned the week before (watching every video tutorial imaginable). Plus I spent 4 days pulling my hair out, and my computer literally threatened to report me, while trying to get MongoDB to actually run on the non-admin account on my computer.
